# Day3 Lab1: Swift Basics 2

## Topics
1. Variables
2. Conditional
3. Optional

## Description
## Task 1
 Every day we make numerous decisions. Different decisions lead to different outcomes or actions. For example, you decide if you can wake up at 6AM tomorrow, you will cook yourself a big breakfast. Otherwise, you will go out for breakfast. Based on that
 1. Create a Swift program that make numerous decisions.

## Task 2
There is no universal rule about when to use if-else and when to use switch. Sometimes, we prefer one over the other just because of readability. Let's say, you typically get a bonus at the end of each year. Now you are making a plan for your next travel destination. Here is the plan:
If you get a bonus of $10000 (or more), you will travel to Paris and London.
If the bonus is between $5000 and $9999, you will travel to Tokyo.
If the bonus is between $1000 and $4999, you will travel to Bangkok.
If the bonus is less than $1000, you just stay home.

2. Write a Swift program that making a plan for your next travel destination based on the bonus at the end of each year

## Task 3
In some situations, you have to declare a variable without an initial value. Imagine, you are developing an app with a registration form. Not all fields in the form is mandatory, some fields (e.g. job title) are optional. In this case, the variables of those optional fields may have no values.   
3. Create an optinal variable called job_title. Then, print message saying that "Your job title is ***"
